# Whats The Weather
A cool single view app that will tell you the min and max temp for the day and what the conditions are like based on your zip code.
Once the user enters in the zip code. the app will send a request to openweathermap and digest the information into a JSONobject  

## API
In this app I have used [open weather map](https://openweathermap.org) to pull weather.
